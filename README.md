In August 2023, the BBC Shared Data Unit [revealed](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-66428191) that a black hole in local authority budgets continues to grow, prompting fears some will not be able to provide basic services.

The project involved surveying 190 upper-tier authorities in the UK to find out the extent of the financial difficulties facing town halls.

It revealed council chiefs expect to be £5.2bn short of balancing the books by April 2026 even after making £2.5bn of planned cuts.

The average council now faces a £33m predicted deficit by 2025-26 - a rise of 60% from £20m two years ago.
